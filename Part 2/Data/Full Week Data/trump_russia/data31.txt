The Justice Department charged 13 Russians with illegally trying to disrupt the American political process, in a sophisticated plot to deepen the country’s divisions and turn Americans against one another. President Trump’s reaction to those charges suggests that plot is still working. On today’s episode: • Matt Apuzzo, a New York Times reporter based in Washington. Background reading: • Mr. Apuzzo and Sharon LaFraniere’s story on the indictment. • A guide to the  propaganda tools Russians used to influence the 2016 election. • A Times analysis of why the indictment makes it harder for President Trump to discredit the Mueller investigation.
