This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!         Mr. Trump, who is in Florida for the weekend, took to Twitter to proclaim his innocence and denounce the investigation a day after the release of the highly contentious classified memo, which he had authorized to be made public. The document claimed that top law enforcement officials had abused their powers to spy on a Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page, who was suspected of being an agent of Russia. The memo, while trying to paint the origins of the Russia investigation as tainted, did nothing to clear Mr. Trump of either collusion or obstruction — the lines of inquiry being pursued by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The memo in fact undermined Republicans’ efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway when law enforcement officials obtained a warrant from a secret intelligence court to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.

They say the F.B.I. should have told the court that the source of some of the information on which it was basing its request for a warrant involving Mr. Page had been paid for by Democrats. Returning to Twitter on Saturday night, Mr. Trump quoted from a Wall Street Journal editorial that claimed the F.B.I. had become “a tool of anti-Trump political actors.”              “The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....                      ...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn’t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” Wall Street Journal         Mr. Trump has become increasingly open about his dissatisfaction with top law enforcement officials as Mr. Mueller continues to interview former and current White House staff members. On Friday, after declassifying the memo, the president hinted that senior leaders in the Justice Department and the F.B.I. should face consequences for conduct he called “a disgrace.” A version of this article appears in print on February 4, 2018, on Page A17 of the New York edition with the headline: Trump Says Republican Memo Proves His Innocence on Russia.
