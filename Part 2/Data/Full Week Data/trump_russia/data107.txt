When all the intelligence agencies conclude with “high confidence” that Russia and Vladimir Putin put their fingers on the scale against Hillary Clinton and in favor of Donald Trump in the 2016 election, when the special counsel, Robert Mueller, indicts 13 Russians for having done exactly that, and then the House Intelligence Committee Republicans release a premature report rejecting this conclusion without consulting Democratic committee members, whom do we believe? This is a no-brainer! House Republicans behaved in a partisan manner and therefore have little credibility. With the same raw intelligence data as the F.B.I., the N.S.A. and the C.I.A. and without interviewing all informed parties and gathering all relevant data, the Republicans chose to rally behind their president. They are failing to act as a bipartisan intelligence committee and providing cover for Mr. Trump when Mr. Mueller’s findings are eventually released. Shame on them and shame on all of us if we allow this to continue! RICHARD CHERWITZ, AUSTIN, TEX. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
