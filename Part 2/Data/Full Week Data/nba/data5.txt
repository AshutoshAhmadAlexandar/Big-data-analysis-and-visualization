SYRACUSE, N.Y. —  Syracuse five-star recruit Darius Bazley, who played in the McDonald's All-American Game on Wednesday night, said he's changed his mind about college and will head to the NBA's development league. The 17-year-old Bazley, a 6-foot-9 forward from Cincinnati, posted the announcement on his Twitter account on Thursday. "Ultimately, playing professional basketball has always been my dream," Bazley told Yahoo Sports. "It's always going to be the dream goal, always going to be the goal until I achieve it. This is going to put me one step closer to doing so." Bazley, who had 11 points and seven rebounds in the McDonald's all-star game, committed to Syracuse last July and signed with the Orange in November.
