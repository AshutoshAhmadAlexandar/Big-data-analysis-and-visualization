If you are wishing upon a young player still challenged by the art of shaving, or a coming lottery prize in the June 22 draft, understand that late springtime basketball is not in your team’s foreseeable future. Know that you are going to have time on your hands and envy in your heart as you watch other cities stage their championship parades. If you are the 71-year-old Phil Jackson, building on a Latvian unicorn (Kristaps Porzingis) and a teenage point guard yet to be named, you may well require job security into your 80s to realize the restoration of Knicks greatness. There is a reason the N.B.A. is the most top-heavy of our professional sports leagues, the most predictable in preseason every season, ruled through the years by a chosen few. It is no coincidence that the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have powered their way through the conference playoffs for three straight years. Beyond a couple of minor role players on the Warriors’ bench, neither side is burdened by the innocence and inadequacy of the unready or unripe. All of their impact players, their centerpiece stars, are toughened by time, burning hot in the crucible of a championship series that continues Monday night with the Warriors in closeout position at home, leading the Cavaliers by three games to one.

Even in the case of the 32-year-old LeBron James, burnout is unlikely any time soon. Advertisement With the rare exceptions of the truly gifted and blessedly affiliated, the N.B.A. finals — basketball’s ultimate stage — are seldom a showcase for those not long removed from the clutches of the N.C.A.A. hype machine. Kyrie Irving, genius innovator of the midair maneuver, was 24 when he helped take down the Warriors last year but was already in his fifth N.B.A. season. Draymond Green was only a third-year player as a part of the Warriors’ original Big Three during their 2015 title run, but he was 25, having spent four years at Michigan State. In his second N.B.A. season, San Antonio’s Tim Duncan was the most valuable player and remarkably poised person of the 1999 finals, but, as with Green, he had played for four years in college. At 20, two years removed from France, Tony Parker was the Spurs’ second-leading scorer in the 2003 finals but was protected by the 26-year-old Duncan and the 37-year-old David Robinson.

Rajon Rondo was a 21-year-old point guard on the 2008 Boston Celtics title team but was primarily a shot facilitator for the 30-and-over crowd: Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett. At 21, Kobe Bryant was gunning for the first of three straight titles in Los Angeles in 2000 but was attached to Shaquille O’Neal and a solidly veteran Lakers cast. Perhaps the most precocious of all, Magic Johnson was the breakout star of the 1980 championship Lakers as a 20-year-old rookie, but he was fortunate to have been drafted onto a team with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And James, at 22, carried the otherwise starless Cavaliers to the 2007 finals, an estimable feat although they were swept there by the Spurs. One team that was dominated by unbridled youth — the 2012 Oklahoma City Thunder — made the finals, losing in five games to Miami. But consider what that effort required: the brilliant drafting over three consecutive years of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Serge Ibaka. Otherwise, the finals through the years have looked much like the 2017 version, featuring players in their primes, the greats still improving with age and those invaluable veterans — Richard Jefferson, 36, on the Cavs’ side and David West, 36, on the Warriors’ end, to name two from this series — hungrily and fearlessly pursuing rings. Think of the more recent championship teams: the Miami Heat with their Big Three of James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, augmented by the likes of Shane Battier and Ray Allen; the Spurs with their international blend of veterans aging like fine wine; the 2011 Dallas Mavericks, drawing on the 30s-plus leadership of Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd and Jason Terry; the 2010 Lakers, led by the 31-year-old Bryant, 29-year-old Pau Gasol and 35-year-old Derek Fisher.

Do the finals provide essential camouflage for a league that many, including Commissioner Adam Silver, complain is getting too young, too lacking in fundamental skills and team-oriented basketball character? During his news conference before Game 1 of these finals, Silver maintained the league position of wanting to raise the minimum age to 20 from 19, while acknowledging that the players’ union remains determined to roll it back to 18, allowing entry direct from high school along with a heavier reliance on the development league. “This year, the projection is that we’re going to have 20 one-and-done players coming, actually being drafted this year,” Silver said. “When we first changed the minimum age from 18 to 19, the following year in 2006, we had two one-and-done players. “So my sense is it’s not working for anyone. It’s not working certainly from the college coaches and athletic directors I hear from. They’re not happy with the current system. And I know our teams aren’t happy, either, in part because they don’t necessarily think that the players coming into the league are getting the kind of training that they would expect to see among top draft picks.” Another bedeviling issue for Silver this season — the lopsided nature of the playoffs, partly attributed to the formation of so-called superteams — may be partly fueled by those draft picks landing on bad teams and then needing years to make significant progress. Losing takes its toll. Free agency offers opportunity for escape to a more dynamic roster in a more desirable market. The cycle of top-heaviness is perpetuated and the story lines of the finals, along with its participants, become increasingly familiar. All things considered, that’s actually the good news.
