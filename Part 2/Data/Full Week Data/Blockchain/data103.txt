Advertisement Michael Novogratz, the former Fortress executive, told Bloomberg that he was shelving plans for a cryptocurrency hedge fund and said Bitcoin will fall to $8,000. “We didn’t like market conditions and we wanted to re-evaluate what we’re doing. I look pretty smart pressing the pause button right now,” Mr. Novogratz said. Advertisement Mr. Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Assets Fund was due to start on Dec. 15. Bitcoin has fallen more than 40 percent the past four days. It hit a low of $10,776 Friday, down from $19,511 on Monday. The digital currency has since rebounded from its low and was recently at $13,268. Ben Protess, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and David Enrich of the NYT report that Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have sought bank records about entities associated with the family company of Jared Kushner. In recent weeks, prosecutors from the United States attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York subpoenaed records from Deutsche Bank, the giant German financial institution that has lent hundreds of millions of dollars to the Kushner family real estate business. Mr. Kushner, who was the Kushner Companies’ chief executive until January, still owns part of the business after selling some of his stake. The family businesses include many legal entities. It is not clear which records were sought by prosecutors, what they are seeking to learn from them or to what degree, if any, they directly involve Mr. Kushner. There is no indication that the subpoena is related to the investigation being conducted by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, into Russian meddling in the 2016 United States presidential election. Click here to read the full story. The WSJ is reporting that Bank of America is handing out $1,000 bonuses to about 145,000 employees who earn up to $150,000. President Trump signed the tax bill into law Friday. Since Wednesday when the bill passed Congress, a growing list of companies have announced plans to pass some of their tax windfall to employees. AT&T and Comcast both will pay a $1,000 bonus to most of their workers in the United States. Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and Fifth Third are raising their minimum wage to $15. Fifth Third will give $1,000 bonuses to 13,500 of its 18,000 workers, while PNC Financial will pay $1,000 bonuses to about 47,500 employees. Boeing said it will spend $300 million on employee training, workplace infrastructure, and corporate giving. Some context on these moves from Breakingviews:  “Compared to the potential gains from lower taxes, these gestures are trifles. In a very simplified world, cutting the tax rate by 1 percentage point adds almost $2 to the S&P 500’s earnings per share, according to Citigroup estimates. Based on a tax rate falling from 35 percent to 21 percent, that’s $28 of extra earnings per share – or $280 billion in total, according to a Breakingviews analysis. Pop that on the historical price-to-earnings multiple of 15, and the biggest American companies ought to be roughly $3.6 trillion more valuable.” Bitcoin is down more than 30 percent and is approaching $10,000. The biggest cryptocurrency traded at a high of $19,511 on Monday. The selling has spilled over to other digital currencies. Ethereum and litecoin are off more than 35 percent. Advertisement Such tumbles are hardly unusual for bitcoin, which is still up more than 1,300 percent this year.              Bitcoin has declined 37% over the past 5 days, its 5th 30+% correction of the year. $BTC.X pic.twitter.com/Yyrfwvm1rx  But the decline has some asking if the top is in. Here are some comments from around the web: Neil Wilson, ETX Capital, courtesy of MarketWatch: “Has the bubble finally popped? It’s hard to see the bell tolling just yet. We can easily see this market bounce back in very short order. Whilst there have been some hacks, public infighting in the mining community, lots of rumored forks and regulatory pressure building on some fronts, this is likely to be a simple bout of risk-off selling as investors rebalance towards year-end.” Ross Norman, Sharps Pixley, courtesy of Bloomberg: “The sharks are beginning to circle here, and the futures markets may give them a venue to strike. Bitcoin’s been heavily driven by retail investors, but there’ll be some aggressive funds looking for the right opportunity to hammer this thing lower.” Michael Jackson, Mangrove Capital Partners, courtesy of CNBC: “The vast majority of long term holders of bitcoin are still way in the money and have shown no sign of cashing out.” Where Bitcoin was on Sunday: $19,511 Where Bitcoin is this morning: $13,577 What Stephen Innes, the head of Asia-Pacific trading for Oannes, told Richard Frost and Eric Lam of Bloomberg: “At the heart of the matter was a frenzied demand for coins with limited supply has now led to unsophisticated investors holding the bag at the top.” What does a top look like? Maybe like a host of companies rebranding themselves as having something to do with digital currency or blockchain technology. What gained a huge amount of attention yesterday, of course, was the beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea Corp. announcing that it was changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. and pivoting to virtual money. (It will still maintain a beverage division, of course.) What happened was predictable: But maybe we’re not at a top. Shane Chanel, a wealth adviser at ASR Wealth Advisers, told CNN Money that investors may just pile into other digital currencies, adding, “I feel the cryptocurrency madness is only beginning.” Goldman Sachs is jumping in The firm is opening a digital currency trading desk, according to Bloomberg. The firm already clears Bitcoin futures, one of the few banks on Wall Street to do so. Speaking of a Wall Street firm getting into Bitcoin, who said this late last month? “If it works out and it gets more established and it behaves more like a store of value and it doesn’t move up and down 20 percent and there’s liquidity in it … you know, we’ll get to it.” Michel Temer, the president of Brazil, said the government would oppose the sale of a controlling stake in aircraft maker Embraer. Mr. Temer told reporters: “Embraer is Brazilian, it represents Brazil very well abroad. An injection of foreign capital would be welcome. But we won’t consider the question” of a change of control. Boeing and Embraer said Thursday that they are discussing potential business combinations after The Wall Street Journal reported the two were in takeover talks. A deal that gave Boeing control of Embraer, a crown jewel of Brazilian industry, would need government approval. From The WSJ: “The Brazilian government holds a veto over any transaction that would transfer control of the company, which was originally state-owned and still has close ties to the country’s military establishment.” The companies now have until June 21 to complete their $85.4 billion transaction, according to a court filing. Advertisement They pushed the deadline back after a trial date was set for the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the deal. The court hearings will begin on March 19, which wouldn’t give the two enough time to complete their transaction before the previous deadline of April 22. — Michael J. de la Merced Who didn’t see this coming? From the Qualcomm news release: Broadcom and Silver Lake are asking Qualcomm stockholders to turn over control of their Company now to the hand-picked Broadcom-Silver Lake nominees based on a proposal that dramatically undervalues Qualcomm and is not actionable due to its significant regulatory uncertainty, which may not be resolved for 18 months, if ever, and lack of committed financing. Broadcom has made no commitments to resolve the serious regulatory issues inherent in its proposal. Expect a lot more fighting between now and March 6, when Qualcomm is scheduled to hold its annual shareholder meeting. — Michael J. de la Merced Eric Schmidt was more than the adult in the room during the early days of Google. He was the technology giant’s person in Washington, Brussels and Beijing. But does his departure as executive chairman next month mean that his services are no longer vital? It comes as Alphabet, now Google’s parent company, and other tech giants need friends in political capitals around the world — and Mr. Schmidt’s connections to previous administrations like the Obama White House may not be as useful. From Dai Wakabayashi, Katie Benner and Claire Miller of the NYT: He has been eclipsed in Washington by others at Google, including Susan Molinari, a former Republican Congresswoman from New York, said some of the people familiar with the company. Google also has new Washington staff members such as Max Pappas, a longtime political operative who has a relationship with Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers who support conservative causes. The personal angle There was no mention in Google’s announcement about why Mr. Schmidt left. But one issue that has hung in the air is the executive’s well-known personal life — including the bringing of girlfriends to corporate events, the World Economic Forum in Davos and other occasions. The Information reported recently on how the hiring of Marcy Simon, a marketing expert who was in a relationship with Mr. Schmidt, at the company’s Android division caused some consternation in the unit. Critics’ corner • Shira Ovide writes, “Google isn’t in desperate need of more adults. But the rest of the technology industry might be.” (Gadfly) • Jennifer Saba writes, “Hiring a strong, independent chairwoman would reflect well on co-founders and controlling shareholders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in more ways than one.” (Breakingviews) Or, put another way, government funding has been extended until Jan. 19. The deadline was today. Yesterday’s votes in Congress to prevent a shutdown prevented Republicans from suffering an embarrassment so soon after passing their tax overhaul. But here’s what will confront lawmakers when they return to Washington next month: • What to do about the young immigrants known as Dreamers Advertisement • Long-term funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program beyond March • The future of the warrantless wiretap program run by the N.S.A. and the F.B.I.

(WSJ) Sure, the iPhone maker’s shares have jumped this year, pushing its market value into uncharted territory above $900 billion. How long can the tech giant continue to breathe that rarefied air? Putting Apple’s market cap into context Courtesy of Jeff Sommer and Karl Russell of the NYT: • When adjusted for inflation, Apple’s market capitalization just recently surpassed Microsoft’s record high. At the heights of the dot-com bubble in 1999, Microsoft’s market capitalization peaked at $647 billion. • Apple’s share of the total stock market doesn’t even rank in the top 20, going back to 1925. Is Apple doing better in China? Morgan Stanley says that the iPhone X is helping stanch the flow of customers defecting from Apple to makers of cheaper smartphones. In a research note, the bank said that Apple has a 57 percent retention rate among iPhone users when they upgrade. That’s 20 percentage points higher than any other brand in China. Why is the country important to Apple? It accounted for nearly 20 percent of iPhone sales last quarter — and the iPhone accounts for more than 55 percent of Apple’s sales during that time. The battery controversy Yes, Apple is slowing down the performance of older iPhones. No, it’s not meant to force customers into buying newer models, it says.

(Washington City Paper) It did so by completing transactions with the controversy-ridden Malaysian government investment fund that have now gotten the attention of the Swiss financial regulator Finma. The Swiss agency will install a person inside the bank to review its money-laundering policies, “given the inadequacy of the bank’s controls.” JPMorgan said that the activity had taken place years ago, and that the firm has since improved its staff training and surveillance operations. Advertisement Potential more scrutiny ahead: Finma said it had referred to case to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. U.S. lawmakers are calling for increased scrutiny of the Chinese conglomerate from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, the WSJ reports.
