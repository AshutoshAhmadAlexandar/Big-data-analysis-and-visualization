I hope that everyone is safe and warm, and is looking forward to a few days of wassail and merriment (or some good books, or catching up on your watchlist — whatever makes your heart sing). Sam Trabucco is just ramping up as a constructor, with five other late-week grids in 2017, and he’s already established himself as an advocate and employer of new words and phrases. Today he’s got an even dozen, including GUITAR AMP, THE LEGION OF DOOM, GALLIVANTED, GIRL CODE, AIRLINE FOOD, STRESS EATER, UH OKAY, ROOM TO NEGOTIATE, and NERF ROCKET. 10A: Although Mr. Trabucco had something else in mind for this particular spot (see below), this clue sort of blew my mind. The answer, EBAN, is an old puzzle chestnut (and I could see a constructor preferring “Oban,” a rarity, in a quest to be original). But I’d never known that Abba, in Abba EBAN, stood for “Aubrey,” which has trended up into the top 30 or 40 names for girls in the last eight or 10 years. 34A: “Went from place to place” sounds pretty neutral and ordinary, as if the answer could have been “ran some errands” or “took a cruise.” The entry, GALLIVANTED, is fun, a much more evocative term that recalls young Frenchmen with lace handkerchiefs and silk festoonery, clip-clopping around Paris on fancy horses, but maybe that’s just me, it also has sort of a bawdy insinuation.

The entry is UH OKAY; “okay” was a snap, but couldn’t “uh” be, well, anything? I’ll give it to them on a Friday, mmmkay. Advertisement 2D: A “common magnet feature” can be only a few things, I thought — a magnet’s pretty utilitarian; it’s got to have a magnetic field and two poles, and some magnetic material like iron or nickel, so I went in search of ferrous metals before I filled in U SHAPE via crosses. A cartoon magnet maybe, but I’ve never seen those Bugs Bunny magnets in real life (mainly because of technological improvements in magnets, I know, but these magnets remind me of childhood). 32D: This is one of those specialty gimmes; for anyone who’s actually done it, “something ported at a portage” is obviously the CANOE that you’re enjoyably paddling hither and yon in bubbling brooks, except when you’ve got to stop and schlep it over land to the next stream all the way over that hill, there. This sounds exhausting. 38D: I’m sure DEBTEE is in all the fine print, but I wasn’t familiar with the term, which is synonymous with “creditor.” It sort of makes sense as a counterpoint to “debtor,” and there is also a “creditee,” although this word hasn’t been in the puzzle yet. Anything to make people a little nervous about money — I’m looking at you, “blockchain” mining. I wanted to make a low-word count grid, so I decided on a big stagger-stack design in the middle and tested out seed entries for a while. Eventually I hit on STRESS EATER; its ultra-friendly letters in combination with how fun a term it is (and, in this case, its autobiographical nature) made me excited to try it on the bottom. Once I shifted the black squares around, the rest of the center fell quickly. It was important to me that the non-central parts of the puzzle not just feel like afterthoughts, which is why I left long slots running through it, grid-spanners on the top and bottom, and additional stacks in the upper-left and bottom-right. Over all, I’m quite happy with how the grid turned out (just HAVE A as a problem in the middle and a few blips elsewhere, which all felt worth it to me). My original grid had OBAN / OLD rather than EBAN / ELD, and though it’s not necessarily a change I agree with, it’s O.K. I am a bit bummed to get scooped on ESCAPE ROOM by just a few weeks (not for “debut points” or whatever — I just worry about a repetitive feeling for solvers). But that’s O.K. too — the presence of GIRL CODE renders me unable to dislike the puzzle. I’ll be flying home to visit my family for Christmas when this comes out — I hope that any families for whom solving crosswords together is part of their holiday tradition enjoy it!
